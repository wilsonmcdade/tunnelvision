    <h3>What is this space?</h3>
    <p>
        This is the Open Canvas, a mural space created by House of the Arts and
        Tunnel Visionaries. Here, we aim to give you a canvas to have creative
        freedom and share your thoughts and art as students. As time passes and
        more art accumulates, this mural will develop an identity and voice that
        represents the diverse backgrounds, thoughts, and creative voices of
        every individual on campus.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Open Canvas is dedicated to fostering the art and expression of
        every RIT student and developing a diverse artistic voice. This space is
        maintained by the efforts of Tunnel Visionaries, House of the Arts, and
        the Center for Residence Life to support this goal.
    </p>

    <h3>How can I add to this space?</h3>
    <p>
        Simply grab some water-based acrylic paint and start working, no forms
        needed! Permanent markers are also permitted, but due to the tendency of
        alcohol-based ink to dissolve paints, they are highly discouraged.
        Please look below for the guidelines and rules! Note that this space is
        cyclic, and art will be added over other art as it evolves. Every so often
        it will be painted white to start with a clean slate, but only once it
        gets covered in art and develops its own voice!
    </p>

        Gallery
        Here is a gallery of photos taken of the Open Canvas as it evolves! Photos are taken at the discretion of House of the Arts and Tunnel Visionaries, and before any time the mural is returned to a blank slate.
        [TIMELAPSE]

        This timelapse, maintained by Tunnel Visionaries, shows the growth of this mural as students share their thoughts, art, and soul on this wall. As it progresses, the students here at RIT will be able to demonstrate their experiences, thoughts, and the abstract side of what it means to be here, and to be human.

                    House of the Arts is a special interest house on campus, and
                    is the combined art-focused group from the previous Art
                    House and Photo House. It aims to facilitate art of all
                    forms, and develop a safe, connected group of artistically
                    driven people.

                    Tunnel Visionaries is a club focused on appreciating the
                    many murals found in the tunnel systems of RIT and
                    advocating for their preservation, as well as the many
                    murals found around the Rochester region. Combining its art
                    and history focus, it also maintains the <a href="/">TunnelVision</a> website,
                    a digital catalog of all the murals under the Residence Hall
                    tunnels at RIT.

                    This project is currently in a pilot phase. As time goes on,
                    if this is successful we aim to improve and expand this
                    mural, and integrate it as a permanent hallmark of the RIT
                    tunnels. In this endeavor, it is important for all users to
                    respect this space, so that it can continue to be the most
                    interesting landmark of the tunnels!
